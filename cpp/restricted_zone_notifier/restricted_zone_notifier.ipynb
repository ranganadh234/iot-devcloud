A trained neural network detects people within a marked assembly area, which is designed for a machine mounted camera system.

By default the whole frame is selected.\n",

A job is submitted to an edge compute node with a hardware accelerator such as Intel® HD Graphics GPU, Intel® Movidius™ Neural Compute Stick 2 and Intel® Arria® 10 FPGA.\n",
